As part of a DevOps bootcamp is sela accademy [Sela DevOps Bootcamp Page](https://rhinops.io/bootcamp).

It includes:

- a module that deploys a linux virtual machine scale set with auto scailing
- a load balancer to handle the traffic
- a use of a config script to load up the app on the web servers
- a fully automated code for a plug and play setup of infrastructure and app.
